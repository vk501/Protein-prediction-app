# Protein-prediction-app
Streamlit web app for predicting protein 3D structures from amino-acid sequences using AlphaFold/ColabFold, with interactive visualization and downloadable results.
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts protein 3D structures from user-provided amino acid sequences.

The app uses ColabFold/AlphaFold models for structure prediction and provides:
- Sequence input interface
- Automated structure prediction pipeline
- Interactive 3D visualization of predicted structures
- Downloadable PDB files

The goal of this tool is to make protein structure prediction accessible to researchers, students, and labs through a simple web interface.
